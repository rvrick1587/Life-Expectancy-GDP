# Life-Expectancy-GDP
Life Expectancy GDP through CodeCademy - Data Science: Analytics Specialist Career Path. 

# Goals of this Project
For this project, I will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries, while also answering the following questions:

  1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
  2. Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
  3. Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
  4. What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
  5. What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
